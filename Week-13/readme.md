The Open Weather Api has been used in this project to fetch the data

This project can be useful to fetch weather data for a city
This project is also useful to fetch weather forecast data for every 3 hours for 5 days
The project returns data in JSON format

I have also included the .env file here which contains my API key, which i am not suppossed
to include but i have done so that my mentor csn review my code and if required run on it
their local system for review purpose.
